    """Peak detection routine.

    Finds the numeric index of the peaks in *y* by taking its first order difference. By using
    *thres* and *min_dist* parameters, it is possible to reduce the number of
    detected peaks. *y* must be signed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : ndarray (signed)
        1D amplitude data to search for peaks.
    thres : float between [0., 1.]
        Normalized threshold. Only the peaks with amplitude higher than the
        threshold will be detected.
    min_dist : int
        Minimum distance between each detected peak. The peak with the highest
        amplitude is preferred to satisfy this constraint.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        Array containing the numeric indexes of the peaks that were detected
